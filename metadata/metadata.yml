  Paper Abstract - The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and sensing technologies that provide (near-) real-time data streams have led to an increasing interest in applying time series data analysis methods to this type of data. There are many methods in this domain that deal with issues such as volume and velocity of IoT data streams. However, analysing the content of the data streams and extracting insights from dynamic IoT data is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a segmentation and aggregation method which represents time series frames as vectors by first applying Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) and then applying Lagrangian Multipliers. This method allows representing the continuous data as a series of patterns that can be used and processed by various higher-level methods. We introduce a new change point detection method which uses the constructed patterns in its analysis. We evaluate and compare our representation method with Blocks of Eigenvalues Algorithm for Time series Segmentation (BEATS) and Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) methods to cluster various datasets. We have also evaluated our proposed change detection method. The evaluation results show significant improvements in analysing time series data in our proposed method.
